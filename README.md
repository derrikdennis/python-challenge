# Py Me Up, Charlie - A Python Challenge



## Background

There are two challenges here that give me a taste of what's to come with Python.
Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situtation where my newfound Python knowledge will come in handy.  It is something that Excel will not be good at!


## PyBank

In this challenge, I am tased to create a Python script for analyzig the financial records of my company.
I am given a set of financial data with two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

For the assignment I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

 - Total number of months included in the dataset

 - The net total amount of "Profit" and "Losses" over the entire period.

 - The average of the changes in "Profit" and "Losses" over the entire period.

 - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

 - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
