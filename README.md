# Py Me Up, Charlie - A Python Challenge



## Background

There are two challenges here that give me a taste of what's to come with Python.
Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situtation where my newfound Python knowledge will come in handy.  It is something that Excel will not be good at!


## PyBank

In this challenge, I am tased to create a Python script for analyzig the financial records of my company.
I am given a set of financial data with two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

For the assignment I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

 - Total number of months included in the dataset

 - The net total amount of "Profit" and "Losses" over the entire period.

 - The average of the changes in "Profit" and "Losses" over the entire period.

 - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

 - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## PyPoll

In this challenge, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I will be given a set of poll data with three columns: `Voter Id`, `County` and `Candidate`.  My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

 - The total number of votes cast

 - A complete list of candidates who received votes

 - The percentage of votes each candidate won.

 - The total number of votes each candidate won

 - The winner of the election based on the popular vote.
